            The goal of Miten is to show areas of improvement, this chart is supposed to
            show that. That's why we ask "What to fix?" when the meeting experience was
            "Good <span>üòä</span> " or lower.

          <Paragraph>
            We asked people who reacted "Awesome <span>üòç</span> " what was good, and the
            responses are on the right side in green.
